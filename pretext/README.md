## GitHub Actions Deployment

The book is automatically built and validated when commits are made to pull requests, and deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch. See `.github/workflows/deploy-pretext.yml` for the deployment configuration.

## R Code Support

The book includes support for R code examples with syntax highlighting. R code blocks are defined using:

```xml
<program language="r">
  <input>
# Your R code here
x &lt;- 10  # Use &lt; for < in XML
  </input>
</program>
```

For interactive code blocks, add the `interactive="yes"` attribute.
