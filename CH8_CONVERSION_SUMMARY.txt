   - Our first script
   - Using Rstudio to write scripts
   - Commenting your script
   - Differences between scripts and the command line
   - Done!

2. Loops (xml:id="loops")
   - The while loop
   - The for loop (xml:id="for")
   - A more realistic example of a loop

3. Conditional statements (xml:id="if")

4. Writing functions (xml:id="functions")
   - Function arguments revisited (xml:id="dotsargument")

FORMATTING HANDLED:
✓ Inline code with <c> tags
✓ Math notation with <m> and <me> tags
✓ Cross-references with <xref> tags
✓ Bold/emphasis with <em> tags
✓ Terms with <term> tags
✓ Blockquotes
✓ Lists (both ordered and unordered)
✓ Footnotes with <fn> tags
✓ Code blocks with proper R syntax highlighting
✓ Figures with captions and references
✓ XML character escaping (< > &)
✓ Special characters (dollar signs for currency)
✓ Em-dashes

SPECIAL FEATURES:
- Proper handling of programming examples (loops, conditionals, functions)
- Code comments preserved in R blocks
- Script file names indicated in code blocks
- Mortgage simulation example with detailed code
- Function definition examples
- Loop examples (while, for)
- Conditional statement examples (if/else)

VALIDATION:
✓ Script runs successfully
✓ Generated file is well-formed XML
✓ All sections properly nested
✓ All IDs correctly formatted (underscores -> hyphens)
✓ Cross-references properly converted
✓ Math expressions properly formatted
✓ Code blocks properly escaped

NOTES:
- This chapter focuses on basic programming concepts in R
- Includes multiple working code examples
- Two figures showing script screenshots
- Extensive use of inline code formatting
- Examples include mortgage calculations, string operations, and function definitions
- The conversion preserves all programming content and formatting
